<p><strong>THERAPUTIC ACTIVITIES</strong><a name="8" id="8"></a></p>

The home offers a range of activities to encourage the service user to keep mobile and most importantly take an interest in life. Staff encourages and in certain instances help service users to pursue their hobbies and interests. As the average age of our residents is 80 years plus, they do not have the capacity for long periods of concentration or physical activity. There is no compulsion to join in for activities and the decision of the resident is respected. Nonetheless, they enjoy themselves when the musicians come to entertain.</p>

<p><strong>MONITORING AND QUALITY</strong><a name="9" id="9"></a></p>
<p>Within the home there are various systems, which ensure that close monitoring is maintained on all of the homes services and procedures. Attention to the smallest detail is pivotal to everything that we do.</p>
<p>An important part of our quality programme is to involve the service users and their relatives. We regularly ask for comments on the home, the staff and services we provide. We also circulate a service user questionnaire periodically, which assists in assuring that we continue to provide a quality service.</p>
<p>We offer choices of meals three times a day with snacks and drinks inbetween and before bed time. The chef is prepared to cook an alternative to the meals planned if the service user has a preference for something else. We pride ourselves in the quality of food served and cater for special dietry requirements. Menu’s are seasonal and on a three weekly rotation.</p>
